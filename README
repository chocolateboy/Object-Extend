Object-Extend version 0.1.1
===========================

This module allows objects to be extended with per-object methods in a similar manner to
singleton methods in Ruby and object wrappers in JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
Object methods are added to an object-specific shim class (known as an eigenclass) which
extends the object's original class. The original class is left unchanged.
